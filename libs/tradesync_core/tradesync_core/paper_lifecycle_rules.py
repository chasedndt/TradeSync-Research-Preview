"""Managed paper position rules: one versioned place for every lifecycle and entry parameter.

Each holding style declares its stop, target, time expiry, trailing stop and fill
depth bound here and nowhere else. A position freezes the rules it opened under,
version included, so a later revision never rewrites an open or closed position's plan.

The numbers are engineering hypotheses, not validated edges. Changing one is a new
``LIFECYCLE_VERSION`` with its reason in the change record, never an edit in place:
results gathered under one version are not evidence for another.

- Stop: ``stop_atr`` average true ranges from the entry fill, the range measured on
  ``atr_period`` closed ``atr_interval`` candles.
- Target: ``reward_risk`` stop distances beyond the entry fill, never closer than
  ``min_target_pct`` of it (the stop widens to keep the ratio).
- Time expiry: ``max_hold_s`` after entry.
- Trailing stop: once the exit-side price has moved ``trail_activate_r`` stop
  distances in the position's favour, the stop follows the best exit-side price seen,
  ``trail_atr`` ATRs behind it. It only ever tightens.
- Fill depth bound: ``max_depth_bps`` past the touch. A taker order on Hyperliquid
  carries a price limit and fills only what the book offers inside it, so a paper fill
  walks no further either (``paper_depth``). The half spread a taker always pays is
  bounded separately by ``max_spread_bps``; this bounds how deep the size may go.
  A shorter style tolerates less, because its whole move is smaller.

v3 (16 September 2026) added ``max_depth_bps`` and, with it, exits that fill in parts:
an exit takes what the book holds within the bound and leaves the rest owed
(``paper_exit_fills``). An entry is not part filled — it is refused with the share the
book could fill — because a part-filled entry would quietly change the size the operator
chose and the planned risk the gates approved.

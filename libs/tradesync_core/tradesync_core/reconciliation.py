"""Compare what this system believes it did against what actually happened.

Reconciliation is the part of an execution foundation that exists to **catch
divergence**, not to cause anything. It reads two records and reports where they
disagree. Nothing here can place, amend or cancel an order, and it works
identically in paper mode — which is the only mode this system runs in.

That distinction is the reason this is buildable while the rest of Slot 6 is
not. `EXECUTION_ENABLED=false` and gate 1.2 returned negative, so nothing argues
for building a signer or connecting a wallet. But a system that cannot tell you
when its own records have drifted apart is *less* safe, and the day that matters
is the day something did execute and the ledger disagrees.

Three divergence classes, and each one means something different:

- **orphan_decision** — a decision was approved and no order exists for it. Either
  execution never happened, or it happened and was not recorded. Those have
  opposite remedies, which is why the class does not guess between them.
- **orphan_order** — an order exists with no decision behind it. Nothing in this
  system should be able to produce one. If it appears, something wrote to the
  order table outside the decision path.
- **field_mismatch** — both exist and disagree about symbol, side, size or venue.
  The recorded intent and the recorded action are not the same trade.

A clean reconciliation is a positive result and is reported as one. "No
divergence found" is a fact worth stating, not silence. But it is only a result
when something was compared: a window with no decisions has reconciled nothing,
and says ``nothing_to_compare`` rather than borrowing the word "clean".

"""Claims proposed by the advisory harness, checked before they count.

The rule extractor abstains on most agent prose. For those posts the harness
is asked one narrow question: *what directional calls does this post make?*
It answers in a shape that carries no authority — ``symbol``, ``stance``
(bullish or bearish), ``horizon_minutes`` and a verbatim ``quote`` — and the
answer is checked here:

- the symbol must be one the system tracks;
- the stance must be exactly bullish or bearish;
- the quote must appear verbatim in the post, so a proposal the harness
  invented cannot become a claim;
- the quote itself must not be negated or reporting (same rules as the rule
  extractor), so "not bullish" and "short resolved" are refused.

A claim that passes belongs to the post's source, under extractor
``harness_v1``. The harness is the reader, never the caller.

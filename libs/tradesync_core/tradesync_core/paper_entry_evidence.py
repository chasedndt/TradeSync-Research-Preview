"""Entry evidence for a managed paper position: only facts observed and received before its entry.

Every item an entry considers is listed whether or not it arrived, so an absent
source is an explicit missing marker with its reason, never a silent gap. Each
record carries when the fact was observed and when TradeSync received it, and its
age at entry. A record observed or received after the entry time, or lacking either
time, is excluded and listed with the reason: nothing learned later can enter an
earlier decision.

The document carries a schema version. ``digest`` is the SHA-256 of its canonical
JSON, which is also the form it is stored in, so the stored copy can be checked
against the fingerprint kept beside it.

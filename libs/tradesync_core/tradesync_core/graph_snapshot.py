"""Validate a ChaseOS ``GraphSnapshot`` before it is projected locally.

ChaseOS is the canonical knowledge instance. TradeSync reads its snapshots and
keeps a local adjacency projection so that "why does this rule exist" can be
answered without a network call — and so that TradeSync keeps working when the
connector is offline, which the roadmap requires.

Three boundaries are enforced here rather than documented and hoped for:

**Read-only.** Nothing in this module writes anything. The snapshot is an input.
TradeSync never produces canonical knowledge, and the projection is derived
data that can be dropped and rebuilt from the artifact at any time.

**No authority.** A snapshot is evidence, never permission. A node or edge that
carries a field claiming scoring, approval or execution authority is refused
outright rather than stripped and accepted — a connector that tries to grant
itself authority is not a formatting problem, and quietly cleaning it up would
hide the attempt. This mirrors ``quarantine.FORBIDDEN_FIELDS``, for the same
reason and against the same threat.

**Referential integrity.** An edge whose endpoints are not both present is
refused. Projecting it would create a dangling adjacency row that later
recursive queries would silently walk off.

The artifact contract is ChaseOS's, at
``chaseos-core/runtime/graph/artifact.py``. This module does not redefine it; it
checks a document against it and normalises what the projection needs.

"""The Windows host tools reach state-api on 127.0.0.1 and send the operator token with every request.

They run from Task Scheduler with no console, so a refusal after the operator
token is switched on would show only as a stalled cursor in a log file. Every
httpx client they open must carry the operator headers, whether or not a token
is configured today.

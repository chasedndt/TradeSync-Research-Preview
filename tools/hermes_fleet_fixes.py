"""Targeted repairs to failing Hermes fleet scripts, applied over the WSL share with a backup.

Each fix is an exact text replacement in one fleet file: what it repairs, the
text it expects to find, and the text it puts there. A fix is skipped when its
replacement is already present (so the tool can run again) and refused when
the expected text is missing (the file changed; look before patching). Every
patched file is copied to a backup folder first and written in place, keeping
its line endings and permissions.

Run ``tools/restore_hermes_line_endings.py`` first: the expected texts use LF.

Usage (repo root, project venv):
    python tools/hermes_fleet_fixes.py [--dry-run]

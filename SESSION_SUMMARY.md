# Technical Session Summary — Claude MCP & Path Optimization

## 🎯 Goal Achieved
Successfully integrated **Claude Code CLI** with a full **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** toolset and optimized the local Windows environment for space-free, stable development.

---

## 🏗️ 1. Environment & Path Optimization
*   **The Problem**: Windows directory names with spaces (`Techno Ubermensch`, `Full Stack Developing`) caused intermittent failures with AI CLI tools and scripts.
*   **The Solution**: Implemented a **Virtual Short Path** via a Symbolic Link.
    *   **Link**: `C:\TradeSync` -> `C:\Users\johno\Documents\Techno Ubermensch\Full Stack Developing\Projects\TradeSync`
    *   **Requirement**: Enabled **Windows Developer Mode** to allow creation of symlinks without Administrator escalation and to avoid file-locking conflicts during folder renames.
    *   **Benefit**: All future AI agents and CLI tools should use `C:\TradeSync` to ensure path safety.

## 🛠️ 2. Claude Code & MCP Configuration
*   **Version**: Updated Claude Code to `v2.1.9`.
*   **MCP Servers Registered**:
    1.  `tradesync_fs` (Filesystem): Full access to the project root via the `C:\TradeSync` portal.
    2.  `tradesync_pg` (Postgres): Direct read/write access to the `tradesync` database running in Docker (Port 5432).
    3.  `tradesync_git` (Git): Local repository management.
*   **Git Initialization**: Created a local-only Git repository (`git init`) to fix tool connectivity and enable version tracking within the CLI.

## 📊 3. Trade Auditing & Journaling Framework
The system now supports **High-Conviction Auditing**. I have mapped the complex relationships between tables to allow a "Full Thesis" view:
*   **Rich Data Capture**: The auditing protocol now pulls:
    *   **Thesis Notes**: Manual rationale, market structure shifts, and retest levels.
    *   **Conviction Score**: Agent confidence (0.0 to 1.0).
    *   **Indicators**: Captured CVD delta, OI changes, and Liquidation Heatmap levels (from the `confluence` JSONB layer).
    *   **Risk Metrics**: Advised leverage multipliers, Stop Loss, and Take Profit levels.
    *   **Lifecycle Status**: Tracks `placed`, `completed`, `cancelled` (invalidations), and `failed`.

---

## 📓 4. Documentation Hubs
*   **CLAUDE.md**: Created as a "Master Guide" for terminal agents. Includes:
    *   Correct Docker service names for all 9 containers (including Qdrant).
    *   Specific SQL templates for the "Ultimate Audit" query.
    *   Microservice architecture summaries.
*   **Runbooks**: Created `docs/runbooks/claude_mcp_setup_verification.md` for manual health checking.

---

## 🚀 5. Final Stack Readiness
*   **Services Verified**: `ingest-gateway`, `core-scorer`, `fusion-engine`, `state-api`, `exec-hl-svc`, `exec-retired protocol-svc`, `postgres`, `redis`, `qdrant`.
*   **Database Connectivity**: Verified presence and health of ~70,000+ records across events, signals, and opportunities.

**Handover Note**: Future agents should use the `C:\TradeSync` directory and the `tradesync_pg` MCP tool to audit trade logic before modifying any core pipeline code.

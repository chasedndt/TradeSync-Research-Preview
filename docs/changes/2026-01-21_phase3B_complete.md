## Phase 3B.0: Provider Discovery

### Provider Matrix Documentation
**File:** `docs/providers/MARKET_PROVIDER_MATRIX.md`

Comprehensive documentation of data availability:
- Hyperliquid: funding, OI, volume, orderbook (✅ REAL)
- retired protocol: funding, OI (✅ REAL), liquidations (PROXY)
- Liquidation data marked as PROXY (estimated from OI deltas)

### Sample Payloads
**Directory:** `docs/samples/market/`

Captured API responses for offline development:
- `hyperliquid_metaAndAssetCtxs.json` - Context data with funding, OI, volume
- `hyperliquid_l2Book.json` - Orderbook depth
- `hyperliquid_fundingHistory.json` - Historical funding rates
- `retired protocol_contracts.json` - Contract specifications
- `retired protocol_fundingRates.json` - Funding rate data

---

## Phase 3B.1: MarketSnapshot Contract

### Contract Definition
**File:** `docs/contracts/MARKET_CONTRACT.md`

Canonical schema for market data:
- Venue/symbol identification (canonical format: `BTC-PERP`)
- Multi-horizon windows (5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 24h, 7d)
- Metric availability tracking with truthfulness badges

### Symbol Normalization
**File:** `docs/contracts/SYMBOL_NORMALIZATION.md`

Mapping rules for venue-specific symbols:
- Hyperliquid: `BTC` → `BTC-PERP`
- retired protocol: `BTC-PERP` → `BTC-PERP`

---

## Phase 3B.2: Ingestion Pipeline

### Market Data Service
**Directory:** `services/market-data/`

New microservice for market data aggregation:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app/main.py` | FastAPI service with health, snapshots endpoints |
| `app/models.py` | Pydantic models for MarketSnapshot, enums |
| `app/processors/normalizer.py` | Raw → Normalized event transformation |
| `app/processors/snapshotter.py` | Event → Snapshot aggregation |
| `app/providers/hyperliquid.py` | Hyperliquid API integration |
| `app/providers/retired protocol.py` | retired protocol API integration |
| `app/rate_limiter.py` | Rate limiting with backoff/jitter |
| `app/store.py` | Redis storage layer |

### Normalizer Features
- Staleness threshold detection per metric type
- MetricStatus classification (REAL/PROXY/UNAVAILABLE/STALE)
- Source metadata tracking
- Proxy liquidation estimation from OI deltas

### Snapshotter Features
- Rolling window storage (7-day retention)
- Multi-horizon aggregations
- Regime change detection with alert generation
- Confidence scoring based on data availability

---

## Phase 3B.3: Persistence Strategy

### Architecture Documentation
**File:** `docs/architecture/market_storage.md`

Storage strategy:
- Redis for hot data (snapshots, recent timeseries)
- PostgreSQL for alerts and long-term storage
- 7-day rolling window for historical data

### Redis Store Implementation
**File:** `services/market-data/app/store.py`

- Snapshot caching with TTL
- Alert persistence
- Timeseries storage with window pruning

---

## Phase 3B.4: State API Endpoints

### New Endpoints
**File:** `services/state-api/app/main.py`

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/state/market/snapshots` | GET | All current snapshots |
| `/state/market/snapshot` | GET | Single snapshot by venue/symbol |
| `/state/market/timeseries` | GET | Historical data for metric |
| `/state/market/alerts` | GET | Recent market alerts |
| `/state/market/status` | GET | Provider status |

### Response Formats
Snapshots include full MarketSnapshot schema with:
- `available_metrics` array with status badges
- `regimes` summary (funding, OI, volume, trend, condition)
- `sources` array with provider metadata

---

## Phase 3B.5: Regime Engine

### Regime Classifications
**File:** `services/market-data/app/models.py`

| Regime Type | Values |
|-------------|--------|
| FundingRegime | extreme_positive, elevated_positive, neutral, elevated_negative, extreme_negative |
| OIRegime | build, unwind, flat |
| VolumeRegime | high, normal, low |
| TrendRegime | strong_trend, weak_trend, range |
| MarketCondition | trending_healthy, squeeze_risk, capitulation, choppy, unknown |

### Classification Logic
**File:** `services/market-data/app/processors/snapshotter.py`

- Funding: Based on annualized rate (>50% = extreme, >20% = elevated)
- OI: Based on 24h/4h delta percentages (>3% build, <-3% unwind)
- Volume: Based on 7-day average ratio (>2x = high, <0.5x = low)
- Market Condition: Composite of funding + OI + volume signals

### Alert Generation
Alerts triggered on:
- Regime changes (funding, OI, volume, trend)
- Extreme values
- Data staleness

---

## Phase 3B.6: UI Wiring

# Mission Control Dashboard Overhaul

Date: 2026-09-01  
Branch: `codex/2026-09-01-dashboard-overhaul`  
Worktree: `E:\Projects\TradeSync\dashboard-overhaul-2026-09-01`

## Repo-truth delta

Before this change, the cockpit used a fixed 224px sidebar, overflowed at 390px, mixed mock/demo language with live Hyperliquid data, called empty streams “Live Telemetry,” exposed browser-only arming/kill controls, and relied on a README/provider matrix that still described removed venues and aspirational capabilities.

After this change, the main screen is a responsive, evidence-led Mission Control view. It explicitly separates market data, intelligence output, context feeds, and execution authority.

## Implementation

- Rebuilt the app shell with a 68px desktop icon rail and mobile navigation drawer.
- Added a measured readiness strip for Hyperliquid market data, scoring output, and disabled execution.
- Added an authoritative BTC/ETH/SOL perpetual market table with funding, OI delta, spread, liquidity, regime, and freshness.
- Left 24-hour price change unavailable until the Hyperliquid snapshot contract exposes it.
- Wired CoinGecko, DefiLlama, and optional FRED context into the dashboard with non-authoritative labels.
- Added PostgreSQL, Redis, State API, market-data, scorer-output, and fusion-output reporting without inventing service health.
- Replaced execution controls with read-only readiness and approval-gated future activation requirements.
- Updated documentation and added the phased roadmap, including future Market Canvas drilldown and far-later Solana screener scope.

## Safety boundaries

- Hyperliquid remains the sole venue.
- `EXECUTION_ENABLED=false`; no wallet, signer, secret, live order, deployment, publication, or spend was authorized or used.
- Context feeds have `execution_authority=false` and do not enter the scoring or order path.
- The canonical ChaseOS vault at `retired private ChaseOS stub` was not modified. _(Corrected 2026-09-11: the canonical instance is `active private ChaseOS instance`; `retired private ChaseOS stub` is a stub and must not be used.)_

## Verification evidence

- `npm run build`: passed; 1,856 modules transformed.
- Docker image `tradesync/cockpit-ui:dev`: rebuilt successfully.
- Container `tradesync-full-cockpit-ui-1`: healthy on port 3000 after replacement; State API/PostgreSQL read latency was 1.99ms at final readback.
- Context-feed tests: `2 passed in 1.52s` from the service-local test root.
- Targeted ESLint was unavailable because this legacy frontend has no ESLint configuration file; the TypeScript compiler remained the static code gate.
- Live API readback before the UI build confirmed Hyperliquid BTC/ETH/SOL snapshots, CoinGecko context, DefiLlama Hyperliquid TVL, disabled FRED, and `execution_enabled=false`.
- Visual/responsive comparison: pending because the in-app browser automation transport disconnected after the healthy container replacement.

## Remaining unknowns

- Browser-rendered desktop/tablet/mobile fidelity and console state remain unverified until the in-app browser reconnects.
- Scorer and fusion are not directly probed by the current API; the UI accurately says “no output” rather than “offline.”
- The current snapshot contract does not expose authoritative 24-hour mark-price change.

## Next safe action

Restore the in-app browser connection, capture the implementation at 1440×1024, 834×1194, and 390×844, compare it with the selected Mission Control reference, fix all P0/P1/P2 findings, and mark `design-qa.md` passed only after browser evidence exists.

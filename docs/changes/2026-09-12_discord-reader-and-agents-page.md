# The ChaseOS fleet in Market Command: two bridges and the Agents page

Date: 2026-09-12
Scope: `libs/tradesync_core/tradesync_core/{discord_evidence,hermes_output}.py`,
`services/discord-reader/` (new service in `ops/compose.market-command.yml`),
`tools/hermes_output_bridge.py` (host bridge, Task Scheduler
`TradeSync-Hermes-Output-Bridge` every 2 min), `config/chaseos/discord-channels.json`,
`quarantine.KNOWN_SOURCES` gains `discord`,
`services/cockpit-ui/src/pages/{Agents,AgentsFeedItem}.tsx` at `/agents`,
`tools/set-runtime-secret.ps1`, `tools/copy-hermes-discord-token.ps1`, tests.

The operator's ChaseOS agents (the Hermes fleet: 85 cron jobs, 74 enabled)
and the Strike Zone alerts post to a private Discord server. The ask was to
move that workflow into Market Command so every system orchestrates in one
place. This change is the read-only half: what the fleet produces now lands
in TradeSync as untrusted material with provenance, on its own page. The
measuring half, each agent's claims scored against outcomes so it can earn a
weight, sits on top of this record.

## What was found (survey of 2026-09-12)

- The fleet runs in WSL Ubuntu at `~/runtimes/hermes-home`; jobs in
  `cron/jobs.json`. 43 jobs deliver to Discord, 40 deliver `local` only, and
  those 40 include the three StrikeZone full-thesis editions and the
  trade-proposal preview. **Every run is written to `cron/output/` first**,
  as `<job_id>_<stamp>.txt` and, for some jobs, `<job_id>/<stamp>.md`. That
  directory is the complete view of the fleet and needs no bot token.
- Two Discord applications already exist (ChaseOS // Hermes, ChaseOS //
  OpenClaw). The Hermes bot token lives in the runtime's `.env`.
- Pine alerts already reach Discord today: TradingView posts to per-signal
  webhooks in the StrikeZone Crypto guild (bias-flip, unikill, FVG, EMA
  cross, EQH/EQL, structure channels). Reading those channels is a second
  route for Pine evidence, alongside the tunnel Codex is building.
- The live fleet still reads and writes `retired private ChaseOS stub`, not the canonical
  vault. That re-pointing remains the Hermes slice's own work.

## What changed

- **Host bridge for job outputs.** `tools/hermes_output_bridge.py` scans the
  output directory over the WSL share (Docker Desktop cannot mount the
  distro here), posts every new run to `POST /state/quarantine` as source
  `chaseos` with the job's name, id, schedule and delivery target, and keeps
  a cursor on file modification time. Where a job has both forms the
  markdown is taken and the flat capture skipped. First run establishes
  "now" and reads forward. Registered as a scheduled task every two
  minutes; first real pass filed 19 runs from 12 jobs.
- **Discord reader for channel posts.** A small service polls each
  configured channel through the REST API, maps messages to submissions
  (agent label from the channel, author, content bounded and marked when
  truncated, embeds, attachments), submits oldest first as source
  `discord`, keeps cursors in Redis, establishes "now" on first sight, and
  holds a channel it cannot read for 30 minutes instead of retrying every
  pass. Never posts, never calls a model, never prints the token.
- **Channel registry.** `config/chaseos/discord-channels.json` names 27
  channels with stable labels and kinds (agent / alerts / operator); the
  reader's `DISCORD_READER_CHANNELS` is generated from it.
- **Token reuse, file to file.** `tools/copy-hermes-discord-token.ps1`
  copies the existing Hermes bot token from the runtime's `.env` into
  `runtime.env` without displaying it. `tools/set-runtime-secret.ps1` is the
  general desktop-prompt path for any other secret.
- **`discord` is a registered quarantine source.**
- **The Agents page** merges both sources, groups by agent, shows each item
  with provenance and intake verdict, and shows the advisory harness
  runtime's status and boundary.

## Live, on deploy

Correction, same evening: the first channel map was taken from a stale id
map in the strikezone project folder, and the first 403s were misread as
"the bot is not in that server". It is. The ChaseOS // Hermes bot
(id 1495832324619632660) is a member of all three guilds and posts the
market thesis into `#market-thesis-desk` itself. The registry was rebuilt
from the bot's own guild channel listing: 65 channels, including the whole
Daily Market Intel category (thesis desk, BTC/ETH/SOL daily, key levels,
derivatives, alt watchlist, weekly recap), macro, cross-market, the
operator desk, every Pine alert category, the quant lab and the review
channels. The reader's poll interval is 60 s at that size.

Reader, first full pass: 53 channels readable and cursors established.
**Twelve return HTTP 403 "Missing Access" (code 50001)**: bias-flip 1m/5m/
15m/30m, ema-cross 30m/1h, fvg 15m, structure 15m/1h/4h, unikill 5m/15m.
The bot sees them in the guild listing but its role lacks View Channel on
those categories' overrides. That is one permission edit on the existing
bot's role in Discord, no new bot; the reader re-checks every 30 minutes
without a restart. Bridge: 4 real runs held, 18 silent stubs skipped.

The advisory harness connector (`AGENT_HARNESS_URL`) is still unset: no
model runtime answered on the host. The operator should say where the
runtime is reachable before it is wired.

## What this is not

Not a mirror of the chat and not a signal path. A held item can be reviewed
and promoted only through the existing quarantine review, and an agent earns
a scoring weight only through measured skill on the evidence cards, by
operator decision.

## Tests

Root: `test_discord_evidence.py`, `test_discord_reader.py`,
`test_hermes_output.py` (filename and markdown-run parsing, delivery
labelling, bounded submission passes intake, fallback label, truncation);
`test_quarantine.py` still passes with the new source.

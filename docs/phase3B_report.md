# Phase 3B: Market Data Expansion (Market Truth Layer) - Final Report

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the accomplishments, architectural changes, and exposed interfaces established during Phase 3B of the TradeSync project.

## 1. Objective
The primary goal of Phase 3B was to build a **Market Truth Layer**: a robust, rate-limit-aware ingestion pipeline that provides real-time market context to explain trades, power the "Market Thesis," and enrich opportunity detail warnings. 

Key principles followed:
- **Truthfulness**: UI never pretends data exists; it explicitly renders `REAL`, `PROXY`, or `UNAVAILABLE` states.
- **Normalization**: Stable mapping of venue-specific symbols (e.g., `BTC`, `BTC-PERP`) to canonical internal representations.
- **Multi-Horizon Context**: Inclusion of 24h and 7d sliding windows for regime detection.
- **Resilience**: Backoff and jitter for provider rate limits.

## 2. Infrastructure & Services

### 2.1 Market Data Service (`services/market-data`)
A new microservice responsible for:
- **Polling**: Continuously fetching funding rates, open interest, liquidations, volume, and orderbook data from Hyperliquid and retired protocol.
- **Normalization**: Unifying heterogeneous data formats and symbols.
- **Snapshotting**: Computing rolling statistics (averages, deltas) and classifying market regimes.
- **Alerting**: Detecting significant regime changes and emitting events.

### 2.2 Redis Streams Pipeline
Data flows through a structured set of Redis streams:
- `x:market.raw`: Untouched provider payloads.
- `x:market.norm`: Normalized metrics with `available_metrics[]` tracking.
- `x:market.snapshot`: Aggregated state for symbols.
- `x:market.alerts`: Regime change and extreme value notifications.

### 2.3 Persistence
- **RedisStore**: Primary storage for the latest snapshots and rolling timeseries.
- **Postgres Scaffolding**: Prepared for long-term historical storage (Timescale integration planned for future phases).

## 3. Market Regime Engine
The Regime Engine classifies market conditions into human-readable states across four dimensions:

| Dimension | States | Logic Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Funding** | `Neutral`, `Bullish`, `Bearish`, `Extreme Bull/Bear` | Based on 1h/24h rates and skew. |
| **OI** | `Stable`, `Accumulating`, `Unwinding`, `Explosive` | Based on % change in Open Interest over 1h/24h. |
| **Volume** | `Low`, `Normal`, `High`, `Climax` | Based on current volume vs. rolling 24h mean. |
| **Trend** | `Sideways`, `Trending Up`, `Trending Down` | Based on price location relative to SMA/windows. |

## 4. Exposed API Endpoints

All market data is proxied through the `state-api` for consistent access:

### 4.1 Snapshots
- **`GET /state/market/snapshots`**: Returns all current snapshots for all symbols and venues.
- **`GET /state/market/snapshot?venue={v}&symbol={s}`**: Returns the latest detailed snapshot for a specific symbol.
  - *Response includes*: `funding`, `oi`, `liquidations`, `volume`, `orderbook`, `regimes`, and `data_age_ms`.

### 4.2 Timeseries
- **`GET /state/market/timeseries?venue={v}&symbol={s}&metric={m}&window={w}`**: Returns rolling data points for sparklines.
  - *Metrics*: `funding`, `oi`, `volume`.
  - *Windows*: `1h`, `4h`, `24h`.

### 4.3 Alerts & Status
- **`GET /state/market/alerts?limit=50`**: Recent regime change events.
- **`GET /state/market/status`**: Connectivity status of providers (`retired protocol`, `HYPERLIQUID`).

## 5. UI Integration

### 5.1 Market Page (`/market`)
- Real-time panels for all major metrics.
- **Truthful Badges**: Every panel displays `REAL` (live), `PROXY` (using related symbol), or `UNAVAILABLE` with hoverable notes explaining the data source.

### 5.2 Overview (`/`)
- **HTF Thesis**: Replaced static placeholders with dynamic regime summaries for BTC and ETH.
- **Provider Status**: Real-time monitoring of market data ingestion health.

### 5.3 Opportunity Detail
- **Market Context Box**: Enriches trade signals with relevant market regimes (e.g., "Do not long during OI Unwinding").

### 5.4 Logs (`/logs`)
- **Market Alerts Tab**: Centralized view of all significant market shifts.

## 6. Verification Tools

- **`fixture_runner.py`**: Offline test utility that pumps sample JSON payloads through the entire pipeline to verify normalization and regime logic without requiring live API keys.
- **`test_rate_limits.py`**: Ensures the `RateLimiter` correctly handles provider pressure with exponential backoff.
- **Changelog**: Detailed audit of file changes located in `docs/changes/2026-01-21_phase3B_complete.md`.

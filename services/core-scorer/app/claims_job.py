"""Extract claims from quarantined material and measure what happened after them.

Two passes on one cadence, both idempotent and oldest-first:

1. **Extraction.** Every accepted quarantine row from an extractable source
   that has no extraction record yet goes through
   ``tradesync_core.claim_extraction``. The result — claims, or the reason
   there were none — is recorded, so a row is read exactly once.
2. **Measurement.** Every claim with an open horizon is measured against
   venue candles exactly as a paper opportunity is, reusing the outcome job's
   candle fetching (1m, with the 5m fallback for old windows) and the same
   guards: a final "no candles" is only written for a window that was asked
   for and answered.

Nothing here scores anything. A measured claim is a row a source card can be
built from; what a source has earned is decided at read time, together with
every other cell, by the same Holm-adjusted machinery as the skill gate.

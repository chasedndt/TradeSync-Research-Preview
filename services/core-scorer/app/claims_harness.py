"""Ask the advisory harness what a post said, when the rule extractor could not tell.

Runs inside the claims job after rule extraction. For each row the rule
reader abstained on, the harness is asked through state-api's boundary
(``POST /state/agents/harness/ask``), which files the harness's own answer in
quarantine and refuses any answer that reaches for authority. The answer is
then parsed and checked by ``tradesync_core.claim_proposals``: a proposal
becomes a claim only if its quote appears verbatim in the post. The claim
belongs to the post's source; the harness is the reader.

Bounded on purpose. One ask takes tens of seconds, so a pass handles a few
rows and the backlog drains over hours rather than saturating the runtime.
Off when the harness is not configured, and every failure leaves the row
un-asked for a later pass rather than marking it done.

Paused while the operator has stopped the agent harness. Each pass first reads
``GET /state/agents/harness/gate`` (kept for ``HARNESS_GATE_CACHE_S``) and asks
nothing while it is closed or cannot be read, and an ask that state-api refuses
with 423 ends the pass. Those rows stay un-asked, so reading resumes where it
stopped once the harness is started again.

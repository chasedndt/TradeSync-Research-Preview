"""Hyperliquid trade websocket subscriber.

Kept apart from ``trade_flow`` so the accumulation mathematics stays pure and
testable, and only the transport lives here.

The subscriber is deliberately quiet about its own failures in one respect: a
dropped connection is retried with backoff and does not take the service down,
because CVD is one feature among many and market-data must keep serving the
rest. What it must never do is present a stale window as current, so the
tracker reports None until trades are actually observed again.

Like every Hyperliquid socket here it sends the venue's ``{"method": "ping"}``
heartbeat (``hl_ws_heartbeat``): a trades subscription only listens, and the
venue closes a connection that has sent it nothing for 60 seconds.

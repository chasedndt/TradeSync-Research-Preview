"""Hyperliquid aggregated order-book websocket subscriber: one connection per aggregation.

Only the transport lives here; ``depth_books`` holds the parsing and the state.
A dropped connection is retried with backoff and never takes the service down.
Each connection sends the venue's ``{"method": "ping"}`` heartbeat
(``hl_ws_heartbeat``), because the venue closes a connection that has sent it
nothing for 60 seconds.

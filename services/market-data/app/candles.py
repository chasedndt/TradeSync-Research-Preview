"""Hyperliquid candle retrieval for the Market Canvas.

Candles are a *display and annotation* surface. They are deliberately not part
of the feature catalog: nothing here can reach the regime rulebook or create a
paper signal. Keeping that boundary explicit matters, because a chart is the
easiest place in the product to accidentally invent authority.

The venue is the only source. No candle is ever synthesised from stored
snapshots, and a gap in venue history stays a gap.

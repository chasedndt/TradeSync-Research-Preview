"""Read the ChaseOS agent channels on Discord into TradeSync quarantine.

A small, read-only bridge. It polls each configured channel through Discord's
REST API with a bot token, maps every new message to a quarantine submission
(``tradesync_core.discord_evidence``), and posts it to ``state-api``. It never
writes to Discord, never talks to a model, and never touches the feature
catalog: what it reads lands as untrusted material with provenance, and stays
there until a human or a measured evidence card says otherwise. Token-, key-
and webhook-shaped text is redacted in that mapping before anything is posted.

Off unless both ``DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`` and ``DISCORD_READER_CHANNELS`` are set.
The token is read once, sent only in the Authorization header to
discord.com, and never logged.

Cursor: the newest message id seen per channel, kept in Redis so a restart
resumes where it stopped. On first sight of a channel the reader starts from
"now" rather than replaying history, because quarantine's staleness bound
would refuse old messages anyway and a backfill is a separate, deliberate
import.

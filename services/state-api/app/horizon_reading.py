"""Hermes readings of the timeframe outlook, one per band, kept with the measurement they read.

A reading is drafted by Hermes from the measured numbers only, through the
harness boundary route, so the answer is filed in quarantine with a receipt and
stays advisory. Each band (short term, lower, medium and higher time frame)
has its own reading. Every attempt is stored (``ops/migrations/030``) with when
it started and finished and the measurement it read, so the page can show the
reading's exact time, keep the last good reading visible while a new one runs
or fails, and flag a reading older than the numbers under it. Without a
database (tests, tooling) attempts are kept in memory. While the agent harness
is stopped (``harness_gate``) no reading starts and Hermes is not asked.

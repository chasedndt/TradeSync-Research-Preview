"""Evidence cards: what each candidate feature has earned, measured the same way.

Slice 5 of the 2026-09-09 review sequence. One card per implemented
directional feature in the catalog, scoring or context-only alike. A card
says how often the feature had a reading at entry, whether its sign called
the forward return better than a biased guesser at each horizon, in either
polarity, and whether any of that survived the hold-out. Every cell on every
card is Holm-adjusted together with every other, and with the same costs as
the skill gate.

This endpoint never changes the catalog. "Earned" is what the evidence
supports; granting ``scoring_eligible`` is an operator decision recorded in
the catalog and its change record.

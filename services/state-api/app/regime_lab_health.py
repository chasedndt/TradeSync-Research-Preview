"""Why the Regime Lab's coverage is what it is: every reading's age, reason and feed.

Each feature result is annotated with its reading's age against the feature's
own stale limit, the feed it comes from, whether it is fresh, and one coverage
reason, checked in this order:

- ``unavailable``: no current reading at all;
- ``display_only``: a value shown for context and never normalized;
- ``stale``: a reading at or past its stale limit (a limit of zero never counts as fresh);
- ``collecting_history``: fewer prior readings than the catalog's minimum;
- ``usable``: normalized and within its stale limit;
- ``flat``: every recent value identical, so there is no dispersion to score;
- ``unavailable``: anything else the normalizer refused, with its reason kept.

"Fresh" means only that a reading is within its stale limit, so no reason is
called fresh: a fresh reading can still be flat, display only or collecting
history.

The overview's health summary counts those reasons, counts the fresh readings
(the only ones called live), and gives each feed its newest reading's age set
against the tightest stale limit among the feed's features.

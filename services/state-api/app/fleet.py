"""The Hermes fleet in Market Command: read model, usage analytics, and directives.

The fleet's files live in WSL. The host bridge posts snapshots of the job
registry, the execution ledger and the token usage audit here, and picks up
directives to apply (schedule, enabled, working directory), reporting back
what it replaced. state-api never touches the fleet's files and never runs a
job. A directive is a request until the bridge says it was applied.

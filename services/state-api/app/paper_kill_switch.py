"""Kill switch: stop new entries and close every open paper position through the managed-paper close.

Engaging takes the entry lock, records the kill and switches the persistent pause on in
one transaction, so no entry can be admitted after it commits. Positions then close one
by one the way the observer closes them (``managed_paper.update``): funding settled so
far is stored and netted, the exit walks a fresh observed book for the position's
quantity and pays the taker fee at that fill, and the close is booked by the same hook
(``paper_risk_hooks.record_position_event``). The recorded rule is ``kill_switch``
(``tradesync_core.paper_kill``).

A position without a fresh usable book stays open and the monitor retries it every
tick. One whose book cannot take its whole quantity keeps the kill-switch exit owed
until an observation can fill it. No price is assumed. Whichever path fills an owed
exit — this monitor's retry or the observer's own tick — writes the same close audit
row through ``paper_kill_audit``. Resuming clears the kill only when nothing is left
open, and leaves new entries paused until the operator resumes them separately.

"""Settled funding for managed paper positions: fetched, valued, stored append-only, read back.

Rates come from market-data's Hyperliquid funding history. Each settlement is paid on
the quantity the position held at that hour, so an exit filled in parts settles each
hour on what was still on (``paper_exit_fills.held_quantity``). Each settlement is valued
at the oracle price recorded in ``market_open_interest`` nearest the settlement
(from five minutes before to one minute after), at the mark price from that row when
it recorded no oracle price, and otherwise not at all: an hour without a recorded
price stays missing rather than being settled at a guess. A row is stored once per
position and hour (``ops/migrations/032``) and never updated.

``GET /state/paper-positions/{id}/funding`` serves the rows behind a position's
funding total.

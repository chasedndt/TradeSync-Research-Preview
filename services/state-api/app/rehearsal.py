"""Paper rehearsal: preview, refuse, journal — with the execution gate shut.

``/actions/preview`` consults the global execution gate first, so while
``EXECUTION_ENABLED`` is false it refuses every plan and records nothing. That
is correct for execution and useless for practice. This router runs the same
per-symbol risk rules, prices a paper fill from the live mark and spread,
and writes the result to its own journal. It has no path to an execution
service: there is nothing in this module that could place an order.

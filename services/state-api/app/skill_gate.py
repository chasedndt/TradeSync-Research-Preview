"""The skill gate, measured the corrected way.

Replaces the by-regime endpoint's method with the one built in
``tradesync_core`` on 2026-09-11 after Codex's review:

- regimes are the **entry-time** labels recorded per opportunity, not an
  hour's own forward returns;
- independence is **counted** from actually non-overlapping windows, with
  symbols pooled, and the error is the larger of that binomial error and a
  block bootstrap;
- three verdicts that are never collapsed: ``detectable`` (either sign),
  ``positive_skill`` (one-sided, Holm-adjusted across every cell assessed
  together, and at least two standard errors), ``economic_edge`` (positive
  skill and a positive mean return after stated costs).

All horizons and regimes are assessed in one call, because the
multiple-comparison adjustment is only honest if it sees every cell that was
looked at. Nothing here opens a gate: it describes evidence.

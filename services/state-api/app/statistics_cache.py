"""Slow outcome statistics, served from memory and measured behind the request.

The skill gate and the evidence cards bootstrap every cell together: tens of
seconds of pure-Python work. Measured per request, each Regime Lab page load
held the state API. Each reading is now measured in a worker thread, one
measurement at a time across every reading, kept with the time it was computed
and served from here:

- an entry younger than the TTL is served as it is;
- an older entry is served marked ``stale`` while it is measured again behind it;
- a market with no entry yet answers ``computing`` at once (HTTP 202) and is
  measured behind the request;
- the refresh loop re-measures every market someone asked about within the
  keep-warm window shortly before its entry expires, so an open page keeps
  finding a fresh reading.

A failed measurement keeps the previous entry and records the error's type. With no
entry to fall back on, the endpoint answers 503 naming that error, and the
measurement is retried after a pause rather than on every request.

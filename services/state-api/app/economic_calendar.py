"""Scheduled economic events, normalised into one card shape.

Two feeds, kept apart by ``source`` so the operator can see which one a line
came from:

- **ForexFactory** publishes a weekly JSON (``ff_calendar_thisweek.json``) with
  title, currency, an ISO date carrying a UTC offset, an impact rating and the
  forecast/previous figures. Its terms are not published; it is treated as a
  courtesy feed — fetched no more than hourly, cached, and expected to change.
- **FRED** ``releases/dates`` (with ``include_release_dates_with_no_data``)
  lists upcoming official US release dates. Needs the same free key the FRED
  macro provider already wants; dates only, no time of day.

Context only. Nothing here reaches the feature catalog. A pulled payload is
still untrusted: every event is validated field by field and a malformed one
is dropped and counted, never defaulted — an event at a guessed time is worse
than no event.

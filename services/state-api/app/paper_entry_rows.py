"""Entry evidence read from TradeSync's own tables, each row bounded by ``as_of`` and carrying when it was stored.

- scorer verdict: the ``signals`` row the opportunity links to (``created_at``), or the
  opportunity's own confluence when that row is gone;
- resting liquidity: the latest recorded aggregated book (``recorded_at``) and its walls near price;
- liquidations received in the hour before entry (``received_at``, first receipt);
- open interest: the latest recorded reading and the one an hour before it (``recorded_at``);
- thesis edition: the latest generated before entry. Its row keeps no insert time, so
  it counts as received when read here, the latest it can have arrived.

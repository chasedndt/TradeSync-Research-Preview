"""Who may change state through this API, decided before any route runs.

Every change (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) passes two checks, in order:

1. **Origin.** A browser names the page behind every change in the ``Origin``
   header, and a change from any page other than the Cockpit is refused.
   Binding the port to loopback does not prevent this one: any web page open on
   this machine can aim a request at 127.0.0.1, and FastAPI parses a body sent
   without a Content-Type as JSON, so a cross-site page could unpause paper
   entries or rewrite a Hermes job's schedule without ever reading a response
   (checked against FastAPI 0.115.2 on 2026-09-15). A request with no
   ``Origin`` did not come from a browser page (the host bridges, other
   containers, curl) and passes this check. ``STATE_API_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`` adds
   origins, comma-separated; ``*`` switches the check off, as a rollback lever.
2. **Operator token**, only when ``STATE_API_OPERATOR_TOKEN`` is set. Every
   change must then carry it in ``X-Operator-Token``. Unset keeps today's
   behaviour, with the loopback-bound ports as the control. Set but shorter
   than 32 characters refuses every change, rather than running unguarded
   while the operator believes otherwise.

Source addresses decide nothing. Docker NATs published ports, so a host bridge
on 127.0.0.1 and a stranger on the network would both arrive from the compose
gateway (172.18.0.1 in the 2026-09-15 access log).

``POST /webhook/tradingview`` is exempt from both checks. It is the one path the
Cloudflare tunnel publishes, TradingView can send neither header, and the route
authenticates each alert with the shared secret in its body.

``POST /state/mobile-alerts/acknowledgements`` is exempt from the operator token
only (``TOKEN_EXEMPT_PATHS``); the origin check still applies to it. It is posted
by the Cockpit's service worker when a notification is tapped, a worker must hold
no key, and the route authenticates each request with the single-use token that
one notification carried, which can record that one alert as seen and nothing else
(app/mobile_tap_ack.py).

``GET /state/access-policy`` reports what is enforced, never the token itself.
A refusal is logged with its method, path and status, never a header value.

The guard wraps the whole application (``app/asgi.py``), so it also covers
routes that other modules register later.

"""Hermes readings of the timeframe outlook on an operator's daily schedule, off unless turned on.

Hermes compute is constrained, so no band of any market is read on a schedule
until an operator sets one on the Timeframes page, with a confirmation. Every
change keeps an audit row with who made it, when and the value it replaced
(``ops/migrations/033``). Once a minute the loop starts a reading for each
enabled band whose daily time has come (``reading_schedule_rules``), through the
same start and run logic as the page's own button (``horizon_reading.start``). It
skips the slot, and records why, when a reading of the current measurement
already exists, when one is running, when there is nothing measured to read,
when the Hermes gateway is not configured, or while the agent harness is stopped.

- ``GET /state/market/horizons/reading-schedule?symbol=``: each band's schedule,
  its next reading, the last slot handled and what happened, and recent changes.
- ``PUT /state/market/horizons/reading-schedule``: set one band's schedule.
